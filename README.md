# D.R.I.F.T
Discrete Relational Identity Fragments and Tools

## Overview

DRIFT is an easy-to-use and understand  toolkit for creating and managing identity fragments. The overarching goal is for users to have portable and contained existances that only initially reveal what is necessary. Allowing users to be the sovereign of their data either through direct control or fair defaults. There are many similar projects across the distributed web and here we intend to primarily interoperate with existing tools in practical and sensible ways.

## Unique offerings

Instead of a token-backed service this is designed to be an open standards API. It should provide a jumping-off point for more custom designs, and with adoption of it or its federated components provide the comfort of familiarity so users know what to expect without reading a long Terms and Conditions document. Initially it will encompass three major components: identity reclamation, digital self-soveriegnty and participatory designs. 

### Identity Reclamation:

It is challenging to compete with large platforms when each user effectively invests hours of time, some emotional investment and a log of their relevant interactions with the platform. To enable self-sovereignty we will have to provide user-level tools to make movement and transer more reasonable.

### Digital Self-Sovereignty

Keeping sensitive personal information on a blockchain or other Distributed Ledger is foolish. It will eventually be broken, and will provide a large attack surface for which there is no recovery, and often no way of incorporating an alarm. Instead user data should belong to the user, it is often very small bundles of associated values tied to one key representing a person. This allows leveraging something like SOLID to empower individuals to grant access to this information when it suits them, and to what degree they deem it necessary. Additionally services offering stewardship of cryptographic keys, SOLID PODS, and data sale/lending should be transparent about their system and reversible when possible.

### Participatory Designs

No one reads Terms and Conditions, they are a bad solution to what is often a design flaw. Instead, it should be clear to users what participation means to them, what is the cost of admission, participation and process to leave the system if they choose? Expressing this in a common format would allow a federation of microservices to flourish without empowering bad-actors to hide in the inevitably vast and confusing slurry of options.
